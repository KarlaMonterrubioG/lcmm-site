```

This analysis, which aims to find latent Crohn's disease (CD) subgroups with
similar faecal calprotectin (FCAL) profiles, uses data from the Crohn's Disease
Inception Cohort [@Plevris2021]. The Crohn's disease inception cohort is a
manually validated longitudinal cohort of `r length(unique(FCcumulative$Patient.number))`
incident Crohn's disease (CD) cases. These are all incident CD cases diagnosed
between 2005 and 2017 with a diagnosis FCAL of
$\geq 250 \mu g/g$, at least one FCAL measurement within the first
12 months of diagnosis, and at least 12 months of follow-up. @fig-flow
shows how this cohort was derived.

![Flowchart of how the Crohn's disease inception cohort was derived
[@Plevris2021] (licensed under CC BY).](images/Nik-flow.jpg){#fig-flow}

Previously, data from this cohort has been used by @Plevris2021 to
demonstrate an association between normalising (< 250 $\mu g/g$) FCAL  within
one year of diagnosis and CD disease outcomes. The outcomes considered were
hospitalisation, surgery, disease behaviour progression, and a composite
end-point of all three outcomes.

Plevris had begun formatting the relevant data into a relevant format for
modelling of longitudinal and survival outcomes, but this process had not been
completed before the data was transferred. This document details the data
processing steps undertaken to facilitate modelling.

The data is currently in long format: one row per subject with one date
column and one associated FCAL value per sample (see @tbl-tab1). As
such, there are `r nrow(FCcumulative)` rows in this dataset. This
dataset has `r ncol(FCcumulative)` columns in the dataset. There are up
to 45 FCAL measurements with associated date columns, followed by
censored status for each of the four outcomes and the associated dates.
Some columns are entirely `NA`.

```{R}
#| label: "tbl-tab1"
#| tbl-cap: "First 5 rows and first 5 columns of the dataset."
knitr::kable(FCcumulative[1:5, 1:5], align = "c")
```

## Data wrangling

### Dropping columns

The first column lists "Overall" for all subjects. This is believed to
be a holdover from the original format of the data, where each outcome
for a subject had separate rows. As such, this column can be freely
dropped. Additionally, all `NA`-only columns can also be dropped.

Furthermore, there are some unnamed columns which give the number of
days between the diagnosis FCAL and the date of the FCAL measurement.
These columns can also be dropped as they will be recalculated alongside
all of the FCAL measurements which do not already have this statistic
calculated.

```{R}
FCcumulative <- FCcumulative[, -1] %>% # drop first column
  select(function(x) !all(is.na(x))) %>% # drop all NA columns
  select(!starts_with("X")) # Drop columns giving days from diagnosis
```

Dropping these columns results in `r ncol(FCcumulative)` columns being
retained.

### Converting to long format

For analysis, it is necessary to convert the data to long format: one
row per measurement.
`fix_dates()` from the `{datefixR}` R package is
used to convert the dates to R's `Date` type. We also map censoring status
indicators for endpoints to either 0 (censored) or 1 (observed).

@tbl-tab2 presents the first 5 rows of the long format table.

```{R}
#| label: "tbl-tab2"
#| tbl-cap: "First 5 observations of the long-format table."
ids <- c()
values <- c()
dates <- c()
hosps <- c()
date.hosps <- c()
progs <- c()

for (subject in 1:nrow(FCcumulative)) {
  is.measurement <- TRUE
  measurement <- 0
  while (is.measurement & measurement < 45) {
    measurement <- measurement + 1
    value <- FCcumulative[subject, 2 * measurement]
    if (is.na(value)) {
      is.measurement <- FALSE
    } else {
    date <- FCcumulative[subject, (2 * measurement) + 1]
    
    hosp <- FCcumulative[subject, "IBD.HOSPITALISATION.POST.1.YEAR..Y.N."]
    if (hosp == "Y") hosp <- 1
    if (hosp == "N") hosp <- 0
    if (hosp == "N ") hosp <- 0
    date.hosp <- FCcumulative[subject, "DATE.OF.FIRST.IBD.HOSPITALISATION.POST.1.YEAR"]

    if (prog == "N") prog <- 0

    if (date.surg == "N" | date.surg == "NO") {

}

FCcumulativeLong <- data.frame(id = ids,
                               date = dates, 
                               value = values,
                               hosp = hosps,
                               hosp.date = date.hosps,
                               prog = progs,
                               prog.date = date.progs,
                               surg = surgs,
                               surg.date = date.surgs,
                               composite = composites,
                               composites.day = composites.days)

FCcumulativeLong <- fix_dates(FCcumulativeLong,
                              c("date",
                                "hosp.date",
                                "prog.date",
                                "surg.date"))

FCcounts <- as.vector(table(FCcumulativeLong$id))

max.followup <- max(c(FCcumulativeLong$hosp.date,
                      FCcumulativeLong$prog.date,
                      FCcumulativeLong$surg.date))

knitr::kable(FCcumulativeLong[1:5, 1:3], align = "c")
```

Converting to long format reveals there are `r nrow(FCcumulativeLong)`
FCAL samples reported in this dataset with mean
`r round(mean(FCcounts), 2)` measurements per subject and median
`r median(FCcounts)` (Q1: `r quantile(FCcounts)[2]`, Q3:
`r quantile(FCcounts)[4]`) measurements per subject. From these
quantiles, it appears the distribution of number of FCAL measurements is
highly skewed. @fig-dist shows this distribution in greater
detail and demonstrates the substantial skew observed.


```{R}
#| label: fig-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of number of FCAL measurements per subject."
FCcountsdf <- tibble(counts = FCcounts)

FCcountsdf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = counts)) +
  stat_slab(size = 0.8, alpha = 0.9, fill = "#235789", color = "#235789") +
  geom_dots(fill = "#ed1c24",
            color = "#ed1c24",
            alpha = 0.5,
            binwidth = 1,
            dotsize = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  xlab("Number of FCAL observations per subject") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Number of FCAL Measurements per Subject",
          "Crohn's disease inception cohort")
```


## Quality control

```{R}
largeFC <- subset(FCcumulativeLong, value > 2500)
```

From @fig-dist-2500, we can see there are FCAL
measurements greater than 2500 $\mu g/g$ despite the assay used by NHS Lothian
having an upper accuracy limit of 2500 with values greater than this normally 
reported as "> 2500". There are `r nrow(largeFC)`
measurements which are above this threshold.

```{R}
#| label: fig-dist-2500
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of FCAL values. Red dots indicate FCAL values above 2500."
FCcumulativeLong %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = NULL)) +
  stat_slab(size = 0.8, alpha = 0.5, fill = "#235789") +
  geom_dots(aes(color = value > 2500, fill = value > 2500),
            binwidth = 10,
            size = 1,
            side = "bottom") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  xlab("FCAL (Âµg/g)") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of FCAL Measurements",
          "Crohn's disease inception cohort (before quality control)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#235789", "#ed1c24")) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#235789", "#ed1c24")) +
  labs(fill = "FCAL > 2500", color = "FCAL > 2500")
```

FCAL \> 2500 has been mapped to FCAL = 2500 which results in the distribution
seen in @fig-dist-fix.

```{R}
#| label: fig-dist-fix
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of FCAL values once values above 2500 are mapped to 2500."
FCcumulativeLong$value <- ifelse(FCcumulativeLong$value > 2500,
                           2500,
                           FCcumulativeLong$value)

FCcumulativeLong %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = NULL)) +
  stat_slab(size = 0.8, alpha = 0.5, fill = "#235789") +
  geom_dots(binwidth = 10, size = 1, side = "bottom", color = "#235789") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  xlab("FCAL (Âµg/g)") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of FCAL Measurements (After Quality Control)",
          "Crohn's disease inception cohort")
```

## Time retiming

We will create a new variable, `time`, which will give the number of days
since the subject's diagnostic FCAL for each FCAL measurement. It follows
`time = 0` for each subject's diagnostic measurement. `time` has been scaled
to be on a year-scale. @tbl-tab4 presents the first 10 FCAL observations.

```{R}
#| label: "tbl-tab4"
#| tbl-cap: "FCAL measurements with time since diagnosis."
tempdf <- data.frame()

for (subject in seq_along(FCcumulative$Patient.number)) {
  temp <- subset(FCcumulativeLong, id == subject)
  # Should already be in order, but worth ensuring
  temp <- temp[order(temp$date), ]
  temp$time <- as.numeric(temp$date - temp$date[1]) / 365.25
  temp$hosp.date <- as.numeric(temp$hosp.date - temp$date[1]) / 365.25
  temp$prog.date <- as.numeric(temp$prog.date - temp$date[1]) / 365.25
  temp$surg.date <- as.numeric(temp$surg.date - temp$date[1]) / 365.25
  tempdf <- rbind(tempdf, temp)
}

FCcumulativeLong <- tempdf
rm(tempdf)

knitr::kable(FCcumulativeLong[1:10, c(1, 2, 3, 12)], row.names = FALSE)
```

From these data, we are able to plot subject-specific FCAL trajectories.
As expected, a high degree of heterogeneity is observed (@fig-spag).

```{R}
#| label: fig-spag
#| fig-cap: "Spaghetti plot of all FCAL trajectories in the Crohn's disease inception cohort."
FCcumulativeLong %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = log(value), color = factor(id))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = viridis::viridis(375)) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  xlab("Time (years)") +
  ylab("Log FCAL") +
  ggtitle("Spaghetti Plot of FCAL Trajectories",
          "Subject-specific trajectories show a high degree of heterogeneity")
```

## Time cut-off

As a sparse number of measurements at the end of the follow-up may result
in a longitudinal model performing poorly for this time-period, a cut-off for
time should be mandated. As such, we have performed an exploratory analysis to
inform our decision on the value for this cut-off (@tbl-tab5). At least three
measurements in the eligible time period have been mandated for a subject to be
included.

```{R}
#| label: tbl-tab5
#| tbl-cap: "Mean, median and interquartile range for number of FCAL measurements per subject for different time cut-offs."
years <- seq(2, 10)
mean.n <- c()
median.n <- c()
IQR.n <- c()

for (year in years) {
  # restrict to measurements within threshold
  temp <- subset(FCcumulativeLong, time <= year) 
  # restrict to subjects with three measurements within threshold
  temp <- subset(temp, id %in% (unique(temp$id))[table(temp$id) > 3])
  counts <- table(temp$id)
  mean.n <- c(mean.n, round(mean(counts), 2))
  median.n <- c(median.n, median(counts))
  IQR.n <- c(IQR.n,  IQR(counts))
}

knitr::kable(data.frame(years = years,
                     mean.n = mean.n,
                     median.n = median.n,
                     IQR.n = IQR.n),
             col.names = c("Year cut-off", "Mean", "Median", "IQR"))
```

From this table, measurements within six years of diagnosis seems a
sensible cut-off. However, we have ultimately decided five years is a better
choice in order to be able to directly compare with other studies, for example
the IBSEN study [@Henriksen2006], which describe 5-year disease activity
trajectories.


Based on the data cleaning step of the pipeline, restricting measurements to
within 5 years of diagnosis seemed appropriate. Additionally, we will only
consider subjects with at least 3 FCAL measurements within this time period.
This report reports descriptive statistics for the cohort after this inclusion
criteria is applied. 

```{R}
FCcumulativeLong <- subset(FCcumulativeLong, time < 5)
subjects.with.3 <- unique(FCcumulativeLong$id)[table(FCcumulativeLong$id) >=3]
FCcumulativeLong <- subset(FCcumulativeLong, id %in% subjects.with.3)
```

There are `r length(subjects.with.3)` CDI subjects which meet the criteria of having
at least 3 FCAL measurements within 5 years of diagnosis. 

```{R}
FCcounts <- as.vector(table(FCcumulativeLong$id))
```

There are `r nrow(FCcumulativeLong)` FCAL
samples reported with mean `r round(mean(FCcounts), 2)` measurements per subject
and median `r median(FCcounts)` (Q1: `r quantile(FCcounts)[2]`, Q3:
`r quantile(FCcounts)[4]`) measurements per subject.  The below plots are updated
version of previous plots: updated to only include subjects which meet this
criteria.

It should be noted `r lubridate::month(max.followup, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)`
`r lubridate::year(max.followup)` is the last month of followup

## Data saving

The tidied data, with a 5-year cut-off applied, has been saved as a  RDS file for
the [model selection](selection.qmd) step of the analysis pipeline.

```{R}
saveRDS(FCcumulativeLong,
        paste0("/Volumes/igmm/cvallejo-predicct/processed-data/cdi/",
               "FCcumulativeLongInc.RDS"))
```
