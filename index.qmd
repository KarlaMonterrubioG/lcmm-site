## About

This website presents the analytical reports developed for *Latent Crohn's
Disease Subgroups Are Identified by Faecal Calprotectin Profiles* by
Constantine-Cooke et al. In this work, we use latent class mixed models to
identify latent subgroups within the Crohn's disease patient population based
upon the profiles of a biomarker, faecal calprotectin. 

The analysis pipeline for this project consists of three stages:

1. [Data cleaning](data-cleaning.qmd) where data obtained from clinicians are
   reformatted and any data quality issues are dealt with.
2. [Model selection](selection.qmd) where latent class mixed models are fitted
   with differing numbers of assumed classes and the most appropriate model is
   selected.
3. [Association testing](associations.qmd) where potentially significant
   associations between latent class membership for the optimal model and either
   data available at diagnosis, treatments, or outcomes are tested for. 
   
## Using this website

The navigation menu at the top of the page will allow you to navigate through
the steps of the analysis pipeline.  The code button at the top of each page can
be used to show all code blocks instead of clicking on the code
buttons for each individual block of code. Moving the mouse pointer over any
citations in a report will produce a pop up box with reference details. Clicking
on the citation will link to the bibliography at the bottom of the page. 

## Software versions

All analyses have been generated using
[`r strsplit(R.version$version.string, " (", fixed = TRUE)[[1]][1]`](https://www.r-project.org).
See the Session Information sections at the bottom of each report to see the R
packages used for that particular analysis and the respective package versions.
